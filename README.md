# Machine learning course projects
These projects were developped as part of the 9th semester course, Neural Networks and Intelligent Systems (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by George Stamou (http://www.image.ntua.gr/~gstam/) in the winter semester of 2018.At these projects we had the opportunity to try and solve different machine learning problems wich will be shortly explained below . These notebooks were developped and optimized specially for the google collab! 


## Exercise 1
At this exercise we were given two datasets. A small and a big one. We had to implement different classification algorithms , and maximize their accuracy using cross-validation and the best pipeline for each classifier. The classifiers we tested are : dummy classifier , kNN classifier , Gaussian Naive Bayes , MultiLayer Perceptron. We also tested different pipelines in order to achieve the best machine learning model.

## Exercise 2
At this exercise we worked on the Carnegie Mellon Movie Summary Corpus(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) which consists of around 40000 movie descriptions.We actially used these descriptions in order to create a movie recommender system. In order to create this movie recommender we used a lot of the well known nlp preprocessing techniques such as stemming, filtering stopwords and lowercasing letters. After we finished our preprocessing we based our movie recommender in distances calculated by the tf-idf algorithm. This algorithm calculates the tf-idf of a word taking into account not only the appearences of the word in the document D but also the appearences of the word in every document.
In the second part of this exercise we used SOM in order to classify movies in different topics.
