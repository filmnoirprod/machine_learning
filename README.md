# Machine learning course projects
These projects were developped as part of the 9th semester course, Neural Networks and Intelligent Systems (of the National Technical University of Athens) taught by George Stamou (http://www.image.ntua.gr/~gstam/) in the winter semester of 2018.At these projects we had the opportunity to try and solve different machine learning problems wich will be shortly explained below .


## Exercise 1
At this exercise we were given two datasets. A small and a big one. We had to implement different classification algorithms , and maximize their accuracy using cross-validation and the best pipeline for each classifier. The classifiers we tested are : dummy classifier , kNN classifier , Gaussian Naive Bayes , MultiLayer Perceptron. We also tested different pipelines in order to achieve the best machine learning model.
