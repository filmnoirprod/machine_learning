Για παράδειγμα η  $f$ μπορεί να μην είναι διαφορίσιμη, η παραγώγιση της μπορεί να είναι δύσκολη ή να απαιτεί πολύ χρόνο,  η $f$ να περιέχει θόρυβο έτσι ώστε οι μέθοδοι που βασίζονται σε απειροστικές διαφορές να μην είναι αποτελεσματικές ή να υπάρχουν πολλά τοπικά βέλτιστα μεταξύ άλλων. \n","\n","Για περισσότερα πάνω στη βελτιστοποίηση χωρίς παραγώγους και τις εφαρμογές της, μπορείτε να συμβουλευτείτε το [\"Gradient Free Optimization\"](http://adl.stanford.edu/aa222/lecture_notes_files/chapter6_gradfree.pdf). \n","\n","Οφείλουμε εδώ να αναφέρουμε ότι κάποιες από τις συναρτήσεις που θα μελετήσουμε με ΓΑ μπορούν να βελτιστοποιηθούν πολύ ικανοποιητικά, ειδικά σε μικρές διαστάσεις, και με κλασικές αριθμητικές μεθόδους."]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"bS3ImgTFUuiR"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Συναρτήσεις προς βελτιστοποίηση\n","\n","Σε κάθε ομάδα αντιστοιχεί μία μη-κλιμακούμενη συνάρτηση (non-scalable, δηλαδή ορίζεται για συγκεκριμένες διαστάσεις του πεδίου ορισμού) και μία κλιμακούμενη (scalable, μπορεί να οριστεί για οποιαδήποτε διάσταση D). \n","\n","Καμία ομάδα δεν έχει τις ίδιες συναρτήσεις συνολικά με κάποια άλλη.\n","\n"," Στο [“Ομάδες - Συναρτήσεις”](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g9otvvm1GIALF5c3Fsf45tULdoDZAmXnjmXyuW4sbro/edit?usp=sharing) θα βρείτε έναν αριθμό για τη μη-κλιμακούμενη συνάρτηση και έναν αριθμό για την κλιμακούμενη συνάρτηση που αντιστοιχούν στην ομάδα σας.\n"," \n","Θα βρείτε σε ποια συνάρτηση αντιστοιχεί ο κάθε αριθμός στο paper [“Α Literature Survey of Benchmark Functions For Global Optimization Problems”](https://goo.gl/qAhxNf), στο Section 3 (σελ. 5 και εξής). \n","\n","**Προσοχή:** ορισμένες συναρτήσεις όπως αναγράφονται στο paper έχουν μικρά (εώς μεσαία) λάθη ή χρειάζονται κάποια επεξήγηση.
